# The-MoneyBall-project

This is a project that I worked on for a course called "Modern Data Architectures II" during the second term of my master's program. Thanks to web scraping methods and different APIs,
my team and I used the football ratings and market values of real players to do analytical football scouting based on market value and current season stats, just like in the movie, Moneyball. 
Please take a look at the following Youtube video of our presentation (please also ignore the long pause between minutes 5:34 & 5:45.. the microphone was having issues!). 
Here is the link to the explanation of our project : https://youtu.be/s5L-TLw5BrY?feature=shared
